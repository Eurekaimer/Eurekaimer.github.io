# CS50x INTRO



## Welcome



>This is CS50, Harvard University’s **introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming**, for concentrators and non-concentrators alike, with or without prior programming experience. (Two thirds of CS50 students have never taken CS before.) **This course teaches you how to solve problems, both with and without code, with an emphasis on correctness, design, and style.** Topics include computational thinking, abstraction, algorithms, data structures, and computer science more generally. Problem sets inspired by the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences. More than teach you how to program in one language, this course teaches you how to program fundamentally and how to teach yourself new languages ultimately. The course starts with a traditional but omnipresent language called C that underlies today’s newer languages, via which you’ll learn not only about functions, variables, conditionals, loops, and more, but also about how computers themselves work underneath the hood, memory and all. The course then transitions to Python, a higher-level language that you’ll understand all the more because of C. **Toward term’s end, the course introduces SQL, via which you can store data in databases, along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, via which you can create web and mobile apps alike. Course culminates in a final project.

## Workflow



采用如下工作流：
1. 打开Lecture并使用A4记录
2. 课程结束后参考Notes对照自己的记录打磨笔记
3. 看完一个课程后复习并自己尝试完成Problem Set
4. 看Watch Shorts Sections

可能存在的一些问题
1. 在不使用暂停的情况下可能比较难以达到边听边记的效果(难度较小一般不会发生)
2. 语言buff比较大，无法Hash map式领会专业词汇
